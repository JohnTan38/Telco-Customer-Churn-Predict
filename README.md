# Telecom Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to the Telecom Churn Prediction Project! This repository contains all the resources and materials needed to build and deploy a machine learning model for predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge faced by telecom companies. Identifying customers who are likely to churn can help businesses take proactive measures to retain them. In this project, we will develop a predictive model that leverages machine learning techniques to forecast customer churn. By analyzing historical customer data, we aim to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of historical customer information, service usage, and churn status. The dataset is located in the [data](data) directory, and it is divided into two parts: [train.csv](train.csv) for training the model and [test.csv](test.csv) for evaluating the model's performance. Make sure to explore and understand the data before proceeding with the model development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- [`data`](data): Contains the dataset files ([`train.csv`](train.csv) and [`test.csv`](test.csv)).
- [`notebooks`](Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb): Includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
- [`churnanalysis'](churnanalysis.pdf):This pdf providing easily interpretable data visualizations, for a clear understanding of the dataset at hand.
- [`models`](models): Stores trained models and model evaluation results.
- [`Deployment`](churn_deployment): Includes files necessary for deploying the churn prediction model as a web application.
- [`README.md`](README.md): The readme file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/usmanbvp/Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment and install the required dependencies by running the provided setup script:
   ```
   cd Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. Explore the dataset in the [`data/`](data) directory and familiarize yourself with the data structure and features.

4. Use the Jupyter notebooks in the [`notebooks/`](Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb) directory to perform data exploration, develop the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

5. Once you have trained and evaluated the model, you can save it in the [`models/`](models) directory for future use.

6. Optionally, deploy the churn prediction model as a web application by following the instructions in the [`Deployment`](churn_deployment) directory.
